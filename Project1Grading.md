# Rubrics
* Overall style and structure:(40 on 50 pts)	
	* Top down design approach - modular implementation (15 pts)
	* Used the random module appropriately (10 pts) ( 5 pts for tree and 5 pts for hut)
	* Clear interfaces between any  two related functions (10 pts)
	* Appropriate use of for loops (10 pts)
	* Contains “if name == “main”:” statement (5 pts)
		* If they don’t call functions from main function
		* If they didn’t call drawScene() from main function Based on drawing uploaded to gauchospace
* Produced expected output for trees (10 pts, partial credit 5 points)
* Produced expected output for hut (10 pts, partial credit 5 points)
* Extra credit: (10pts)
	* This is extra work. Any non-trivial work would be fine. The standard of non-trivial is totally up to whoever grades homework 
	* Trivial : 2 pts Medium: 5 pts Spectacular: 10 pts
