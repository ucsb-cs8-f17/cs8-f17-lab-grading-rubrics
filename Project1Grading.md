		* If they don't call functions from main function
		* If they didn't call drawScene() from main function
Based on drawing uploaded to gauchospace
* Produced expected output for trees (20 pts, partial credit 10 points)
* Produced expected output for hut  (20 pts, partial credit 10 points)
* Used the random module appropriately (20)  ( 10 pts for tree and 10 pts for hut)

* Extra credit: (10pts)
	* This is extra work. Any non-trivial work would be fine. The standard of non-trivial is totally up to whoever grades homework
